Born and raised in Austin, I'm a Senior Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Arlington.

During my studies, I have developed many programs, such as a Connect 4 game in Java implementing an AI opponent, an algorithm in C for finding optimal routes between cities using heuristics, and an HTTP server in Java.

I am the Founder of a personal finance website. Additionally, I have been a member of The Alpha Tau Omega - America's Leadership Development Fraternity at UT Arlington for 4 years.

I hope to use my programming skills to work on more advanced and cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence and Information Security technologies.
